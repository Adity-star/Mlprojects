## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Students Performance Indicator** is a data-driven project aimed at analyzing student performance based on various factors such as gender, parental education, lunch type, test preparation course, and scores in mathematics, reading, and writing. By leveraging machine learning models, this project provides predictive insights into student outcomes, helping educators and policymakers improve academic performance.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding correlations and patterns using statistical analysis and visualization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing regression and classification algorithms to predict student performance.
- **Model Evaluation & Optimization**: Fine-tuning models for better accuracy and interpretability.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model as an API using Flask/Streamlit for real-world applications.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Deployment**: Flask / Streamlit (optional)
